Control software
====

This directory contains code for control software which is used by the vehicle to participate in the competition and which was developed by the us.

All artifacts required to resolve dependencies and build the project are included in this directory as well. 

NOTE : We have done this project in EV3 mindstrom education app . But we were not able to attach the file of the EV3 software . So we have instead updated a screenshot.

Sorry for any inconvinience.
